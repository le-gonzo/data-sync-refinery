    # ---------------
    # The following steps guide you on how to utilize the SSRSExtractor to extract data.

    try:
        # Example data source name; you'd replace this with a valid source from your config.
        data_source_name = "your_data_source_name_here"

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred while extracting: {e}")

    # DEBUGGING:
    # ----------
    # If you encounter issues, here are steps to help you debug:

    # a. Ensure your logging level is set to DEBUG in config.ini for detailed logs.
    # b. Check your data source configurations in config.yml.
    # c. Ensure your credentials (e.g., for SSRS) are correctly set in the secret manager.
    
    # ADDITIONAL UTILITIES:
    # ---------------------
    # The SSRSExtractor also provides a `connect` and `close` method, even though they are 
    # not traditionally used for SSRS (which is based on HTTP requests). You can use them 
    # if you extend the class for other systems that require connection handling.

    # Remember, the `extract` method allows for optional parameters like output_path and 
    # filename. You can use them to specify custom save locations or filenames.

    # e.g., 
    # result = extractor.extract(data_source_name=data_source_name, output_path="/path/to/save", filename="custom_name.csv")
